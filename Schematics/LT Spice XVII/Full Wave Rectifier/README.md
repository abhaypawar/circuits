# Full Wave Rectifier 
Schematics .asc files for both types namely
Resistive Load FWR and CR Load FWR
#### Inference
1. Resistive Load : AC-DC conversion is rough and has ripples and unstability in wave form
2. CR Load : AC-DC conversion with following specifications 
Capacitance 10u slightly stable
Capacitance 100u considerably stable
#### Thus, with higher value of C in CR FWR, the AC-DC efficiency of circuit increases
